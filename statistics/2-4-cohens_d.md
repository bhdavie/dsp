[Think Stats Chapter 2 Exercise 4](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2003.html#toc24) (Cohen's d)

>> Using Cohen's D, I determined that first born children are lighter than second born children. The value for Cohen's D was -0.0867 which shows the mean weight of the first born children is less than the mean weight of the second born children. I applied Cohen's D to the length of pregnencies and found that first born children have longer pregnencies than second borns (Cohen's D for pregnencies legnth: 0.0288).
